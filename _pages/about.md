Welcome! I am a graduate student at Binghamton University. After completing my undergraduate work at Binghamton I received two Bachelor's Degrees in Statistics and Politics, Philosophy & Law. I am now completing my Master's Degree in Statistics. I am interested in applying my knowledge of prediction models to Capital Markets.
